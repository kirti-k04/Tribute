                <br><br>
                Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 – 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and mechanical
                engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to go to space.She first flew on Space Shuttle 
                Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator.

                Her second flight was on STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003.
                Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster 
                when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 
                Feb 1, 2003.Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, 
                and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor. 
                She is regarded as a national hero in India.

                <br><br>
                Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryana. She completed her schooling 
                from Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. She went to local flying clubs
                and watched planes with her father. Her date of birth was falsified by her family to 1 July
                1961, to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam. After getting a Bachelor 
                of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, 
                she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace 
                Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984. Chawla went on to earn a 
                second Masters in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of 
                Colorado Boulder.

                <br><br>
                In 1994, Chawla was selected as an astronaut candidate. After a year of training, she became
                a crew representative for the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches, where she
                worked with Robotic Situational Awareness Displays and tested software for the space shuttles.
                Chawla's first flight came in November 1997, aboard the space shuttle Columbia on flight STS-87.
                The shuttle made 252 orbits of the Earth in just over two weeks. Chawla was a mission specialist 
                and prime robotic arm operator for the flight. In 2001, Chawla was selected for her second flight 
                as part of the crew of STS-107. 
                On 16 January 2003, Chawla returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated 
                STS-107 mission. She was a well-known researcher, making significant contribution to the development 
                of space technology. She is especially known for her work on the simulation of moving multiple body 
                problems.

                <br><br>
                In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second voyage into space, to serve as a mission specialist on STS-107.
                The mission was delayed several times before finally launching on Jan. 16, 2003. On the morning of Feb. 1, 2003,
                the space shuttle returned to Earth, intending to land at Kennedy Space Center. But as the shuttle passed through
                Earth's atmosphere, hot gas streamed into the shuttle's wing where  insulation had broken off during launch and 
                damaged the thermal protection system.
 
                The unstable craft rolled and bucked, pitching the astronauts about. Less than a minute passed before the ship 
                depressurized, killing the crew. Also on board were Rick Husband, Laurel Clark, Ilan Ramon, David Brown, William
                 McCool and Michael Anderson.
                The shuttle broke up over Texas and Louisiana before plunging into the ground. The accident was the second major
                disaster for the space shuttle program, following the 1986 explosion of the shuttle Challenger.

                On 5 February 2003, the Prime Minister of India at the time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, announced that a 
                meteorological series of satellites, MetSat, was to be renamed "Kalpana 1". 

                Asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla, one of seven named after the Columbia's crew
                The lunar crater Chawla is named after Kalpana Chawla.

                The 14th contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft mission delivering supplies to the
                 ISS was named the S.S. Kalpana Chawla after her.

                The University of Texas at Arlington, where Chawla obtained a Master of Science degree in 
                aerospace engineering in 1984, opened a dormitory named Kalpana Chawla Hall in 2004. In addition,
                the university dedicated the Kalpana Chawla Memorial on 3 May 2010.
